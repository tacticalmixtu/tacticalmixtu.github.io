      <description>Memory Model Each go routine is assigned a stack with an initial space of 2KB Each function is assigned as frame a function could only access memory directly within that frame function call creates a new frame(below the calling function, since frames lay in a stack which grows down, from high address to low address) clean up that space invalid deliminator is moved downside passed by value array parameter is regarded pretty same as an int pass by value applies for both function call and return function return invalid deliminator is moved upward cleanup operation is done during function call to save time Escape analysis Escape analysis is the process that the compiler uses to determine the placement of values that are created by your program.</description>

      <description>Introduction A little history ASCII
represents English characters and some other control characters only 8 bits only 7 bits are defined in standard unprintable characters are below 32 codes from 128 to 255 are defined in a variety of way by different manufactures, these different systems were called code pages asian language include more characters that exceed the limit of 8 bits Unicode
a single character set that included every reasonable writing system a letter maps to something called a code point, U+0639 code point points to a concept, which may represents more characters Encodings define how to store these code points store-it-in-two-byte methods are called UCS-2 (because it has two bytes) or UTF-16 (because it has 16 bits) store as it were in hex format storing a FE FF at the beginning of every Unicode string; this is called a Unicode Byte Order Mark incompatible of old ASCII related UTF-8, Unicode Transformation Formats every code point from 0-127 is stored in a single byte, compatible with ASCII Only code points 128 and above are stored using 2, 3, in fact, up to 6 bytes UCS-4 UCS-4, which stores each code point in 4 bytes, which has the nice property that every single code point can be stored in the same number of bytes, wastes memory UTF-7, which is a lot like UTF-8 but guarantees that the high bit will always be zero, so that if you have to pass Unicode through some kind of draconian police-state email system that thinks 7 bits are quite enough, http header Content-type</description>

      <title>Handlers and Multiplexers in http package</title>

      <description>This article introduces common types/methods in http package to start a http server. It clarifies some confusing points in a rather superficial way.
Start a http server http.ListenAndServe(address string, h Handler) error if handler is nil, then DefaultServeMux is used TCP keep-alive is enabled for each incoming connection, a go routine is created, therefore access control should be applied manually Handler and Multiplexer Handler is an interface type Handler interface { ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request) } type dollars float32 // satisfy stringer interface func (d dollars) String() string { return fmt.</description>

      <title>How to deal with error in Go</title>

      <description>Prelude Any program may fall into wrong logic paths. And Go provides two mechanisms: error and panic. Errors could be used to inspect a execution result of a function, while panic generally represents a severe problem that may crash the whole program.
This article focus on error handling, which is a tricky yet critical part of go programming.
A little background Inheritance from C: return a number to denote execution result Benefits from multiple return values in Go Fundamental concepts // definition of error interface type error interface { Error() string } // New returns an error that formats as the given text.</description>
